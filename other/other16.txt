Levying of penal charge in loan accounts
This is not a promotional Mail and this email does not contain any promotional material. Dear Customer, Greetings from Federal Bank. Thank you for your association with us and the continued patronage. We wish to bring to your kind attention about an important update in your loan accounts. As per recent guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), with effect from 01st July 2024, penal charges will be levied in loan accounts instead of penal interest for non-compliance of Material Terms and Conditions (MTCs). If any of the sanction order conditions are pending for compliance in your existing loan accounts, kindly contact your Branch and submit necessary documents, if any. Please note: (a) Penal charges will be collected only for the actual number of days for which the account is in default/ has arrears/ is overdrawn (or) for the actual number of days for which the material terms and conditions remained non-complied. (b) Penal charges will not be compounded/ capitalized i.e., Penal charges debited to the loan account and pending servicing/ recovery will be excluded from the balance outstanding while computing future interest. For more detailed information, please visit our website. (Home-Customer relations-Search-Penal charges) If you have any further questions or need clarifications, feel free to contact our branch or our customer service center at 18004201199. Regards, Federal Bank.
