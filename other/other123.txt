You likely already know that the city drastically reduced funding for its public libraries in its mid-year budget back in November: Now our beloved public libraries stand to lose even more funding—even as thousands of New Yorkers continue to turn to us every day for our free and essential resources, including career counseling and tutoring, early literacy classes, and access to millions of books. Tomorrow is the final day of our Emergency Budget Campaign and we're still looking for library supporters like you to contribute to our fund and send a strong message to City Hall: No cuts to libraries! Donate to our Emergency Budget Campaign now—your gift will be instantly doubled and will go twice as far toward covering crucial operating costs. We'll send you a limited-edition bookmark as a sign of our appreciation for your support. Donate today and your gift goes 2x as far A contribution to our Emergency Budget Campaign helps to ensure that, even in the face of these cuts, New Yorkers can continue to enjoy free and open access to information, a cornerstone of our democracy.

Your first donation will be instantly doubled and will go twice as far toward providing New Yorkers everywhere with the resources they need.
