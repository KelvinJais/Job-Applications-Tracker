But since November 2023, when mid-year city budget cuts forced our public libraries to reduce essential services—including ending Sunday service at most branches that offered it and scaling back programming, maintenance, and more—NYPL has had to make tough decisions about what we can offer at our branches. Now that the city has proposed additional budget cuts for libraries in the FY25 city budget, we must evaluate once more what materials, programming, and open hours we can continue to afford. Today we're turning to library supporters like you. If you've ever found value from NYPL's free services, there's no better time to make your first ever donation to the Library and help us make a statement about the importance of city funding to New York City's public libraries. We're looking for 1,000 people to make a contribution now to help us narrow our funding gap, sending a message to City Hall: No cuts to libraries! All donations will be instantly matched, and we'll send you a limited-edition bookmark as a thank you for defending our public libraries. Donate today and your gift goes 2x as far Our Emergency Budget Campaign is critical: Public library patrons shouldn't have to worry about whether their local branch will need to go down to five day service. We need both donations and city funding to keep our operations going strong. One way you can show your support for New York City's public libraries is to make a contribution today. Even $5 sends a strong message to City Hall: New Yorkers want their libraries to be fully funded. Can we count on you today? Make a contribution now while your support will be doubled. Your gift will be matched dollar-for-dollar and will help us fund our collections, plan more programming, and continue to offer free access to job search resources, literacy classes, children's story hours, and millions of books, e-books, and other materials. Give now to our Emergency Budget Campaign and your gift will go twice as far as we send a message to City Hall: No cuts to libraries! When you donate, we'll send you a limited-edition bookmark to personalize a book in your own collection. Thank you for your support as we continue to show up for all New Yorkers.
