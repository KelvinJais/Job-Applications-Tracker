First, you can now make a beautiful website (with a custom domain!) in Notion. Second, a sneak peek at a much-requested feature—charts! 📊 Make a Site Build a Notion Site in minutes Launching a website should be easy. So we turned Notion’s one-click “Publish“ button into a full suite of features called Notion Sites. I’m already seeing people create personal websites, portfolios, travel guides, event pages, and hobbies (like this site from our video producer, Cory, who’s also an avid birder). www.YOURIDEA.com Connect your own domain or use a custom notion.site URL (I put my photography on ivanzhaophotos.com 😊). Make it yours You can now customize your top header, choose a light or dark theme, and add the perfect favicon with features available on the Plus plan. Build your audience with better SEO and Google Analytics Just because you built it doesn’t mean they’ll come. Add custom metadata to make your site easier to find on search engines. Then, integrate with Google Analytics to track all of your new visitors. Coming soon Charts! (We know you’ve been waiting) We love charts. They turn data into a story. Soon you’ll be able to create bar charts, line charts, and donut charts to visualize progress on work and life projects. Use them for anything you track in Notion: tasks, habits, budgets, and more. Charts will launch in the coming weeks. They'll be free to try, with unlimited charts available on the Plus, Business, and Enterprise plans Quality of life improvements • Easier commenting: You can now right-click on a database entry and add a comment without having to actually open it to a full-page view. • Better "find": Cmd+f / Ctrl+f can now find hidden content in collapsed toggles or within databases. It also does elegant things like closes automatically when you start to edit or navigate to a new page. Try Sites I can't wait to see all the sites you create. Share them with us on social @NotionHQ and we’ll retweet! Ivan P.S. Watch our designer, Ein, give a full tour of Notion Sites → Write, plan, organize. In one AI-powered workspace.
