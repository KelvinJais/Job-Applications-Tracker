That's why we're still looking for more donors to stand up for libraries and send a strong message to city leaders: No cuts to libraries! When you make a gift to our Emergency Budget Campaign, you'll instantly double your support for everything that NYPL offers for free: afterschool programs, tutoring, career counseling, ESOL classes, plus access to millions of books, e-books, and other materials. If you've ever benefited from NYPL's myriad resources, please consider contributing to our Emergency Budget Campaign and helping to ensure that New Yorkers of every age and background continue to enjoy our free and essential resources. As a sign of our appreciation for your support, we'll send you a limited-edition bookmark to place in your favorite or current library book. Donate $50 Donate $100 Donate $250 I'll be frank with you: The city's mid-year budget cuts in November 2023 are the reason that we had to cut Sunday service at all locations that offer it. The city's recently announced budget for the new fiscal year means that we will face serious further reductions in open hours and in other services. That's why we're counting on the crucial support of everyday Library patrons like you to support our mission of more than 125 years. Please make a gift now to our Emergency Budget Campaign and double your support for our mission to inspire lifelong learning, advance knowledge, and strengthen New York's communities. We need donations and city funding to uphold the Library's free and essential services. Even a gift of $5 sends a message to the city that New Yorkers want full restoration of funding for their libraries. All donations will be matched by a group of generous donors to double the impact and double the strength of our message. Thank you for all that you do for New Yorkers.
