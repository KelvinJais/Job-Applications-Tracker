Update to our Player Agreements
Hi, In the coming weeks, we’re making some updates to our player agreements for Fortnite, Rocket League, Fall Guys, the Epic Games Store, and our Terms of Service. We’re updating the arbitration provisions in these agreements to name a new arbitration provider and add a new process for coordinated claims. This will make the dispute resolution process more efficient if more than one individual comes to Epic with a related claim. We continue to encourage players to reach out to player support if you have an issue with our products or services so we can work together to address your concerns. We’ve posted these changes online so you can take a look at them before they go into effect on July 17, 2024. To review them click “Read New Terms” at the top of the pages below: Fortnite Rocket League and Rocket League Sideswipe Fall Guys The Epic Games Store Epic’s Terms of Service Starting July 17, 2024, we’ll ask you to review and accept the updated terms the next time you log in.
