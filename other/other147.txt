While time is unkind and irreversible, we can still help the next generation avoid our mistakes by sharing the knowledge we've gained along the way. Here are some things I wish I had done as a first-year B.Tech Computer Science student.1. Not learning Computer Science Basics firstI took up computer science in the 11th and 12th standards, so I was familiar with C++. While this gave me a slight edge over my peers who couldn't tell the difference between an int and a string, diving headfirst into a programming language wasn't the best approach. It would have been far more beneficial to start with the fundamentals.2. Not joining any clubs or chaptersCollege clubs and chapters are fantastic for networking and building a community of like-minded people. They not only enhance your resume but also teach camaraderie and teamwork.In my case, I didn't apply for many clubs and chapters. For the ones I did apply to, I didn't get in on my first try. Then, the infamous COVID-19 pandemic took over our lives, and in the online era, I almost forgot about them as college transformed into a laptop screen.3. Not Watching the ClassicsA rite of passage for almost all Computer Science students is to go through some classic playlists that would teach one more than any college lecture couldCS50 Harvard - Introduction to Computer ScienceThis one playlist teaches you all about the art of programming and gives the best introduction for web development.freeCodeCamp.org - College AlgebraThis playlist will save you one day before examinations and have been referenced by almost all before their college algebra and calculus examsfreeCodeCamp.org - Data Structures Beginner to AdvancedProbably the only tutorial you will ever need to watch for learning the basics of data structures.4. Not knowing the correct educators and learning pathsIf you want to learn absolutely anything in Computer Science it is available for free on the internet, the only thing is you don't always know where to look for it. The easiest way is to do a simple google or YouTube search like Full Stack Developer Roadmap. This would give you a list of steps to follow and what to learn in each step but if that is not enough here are a list of online educators that got me through engineering.freeCodeCampThis is the mother ship for almost any computer programming language, framework or design pattern.Angela YuAs a first year BTech student the very first course on Web development I took up was that of Angela Yu on Udemy and it taught me almost the basics of programming. Her USP is that she teaches with interactive visuals and helps you build something functional in every module.Her courses on Web Development, Flutter and iOS development are all a great way to dive into something new If you have pushed through the basics and want to build full scaled deployable web applications, here are some channels to checkoutClever ProgrammerSonny SanghaJavascript Mastery5. Not taking in the journeyWhile it's important to have clear goals and work towards them during your four years of college, those years can rush by in the blink of an eye. It's essential to take it all in and enjoy the process. So, alongside those daily LeetCode problems, make sure to hang out with your friends at the college café.These are some of the things I wish I knew as a first-year B.Tech student.
