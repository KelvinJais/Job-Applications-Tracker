And it’s no secret that I’m a huge fan of them. Each morning, I check my inbox, and my favorite newsletters are waiting to fill me in on the latest and greatest in the fields to which I’ve subscribed. And this is largely general news, finance, and AI. That being said, I haven’t really found a great one yet for programming that covers all my bases. One that not only provides the latest programming and tech news but also delivers AI updates and offers insights into the tech job markets. So I'm excited to announce that I’m creating my own weekly newsletter, a project I've been eagerly working on, with my own flavor of content that I’ve provided now for years. The first edition went out yesterday, you can go and read it before even signing up. But if you want it delivered to your inbox, once a week, and you want to become an "informed" software developer, then I would encourage to go sign up to it. It's free. It's fun. It's informative. Signup here. As always, I value your input, so please feel free to shoot me a response with any questions or suggestions.
