We will strive to get back to you as soon as possible, but please note that due to the thoroughness of our review process and the volume of applications we receive, it could be about 2+ weeks. Please note, if you are applying to one of our roles in Early Careers/University Recruiting (i.e. Development Program, Intern Program or Co-op Program)—this timeline may be a little different.We hope all of our candidates are excited about a potential future at 84.51°, but we also understand that the job hunt can be stressful and time-consuming. In an effort to help you pass the time and better understand 84.51°, we have included some information about our interview process and business. What is the interview process like for 84.51°?For our Early Careers/University Programs (Development Program, Intern Program or Co-op Program):1. Review: members of the function you are applying for will review your resume and application.2. 1st Round Interview: If your application is selected, you'll be contacted for a 1st round interview (phone or campus interview). This interview is with 1-2 interviewers who ask a blend of behavioral and role-based questions. If you are interviewing for an Engineering position, you'll have a take-home coding test if you pass your 1st round interview.3. 2nd/Final Round Interview: If you pass that interview, you'll be invited for a 2nd (and final) round of interviews. The final round of interviews typically consist of two interviews with 1-2 interviewers for each interview. Most of our interviews strive to have a balance of technical questions that are relative to the skills necessary to be successful in the role, and behavioral questions to see if you fit our values. If you are interviewing for an Engineering position, you'll only have 1 interview for this round that is paired programming.4. Offer Decision: After all of your interviews are complete, we'll be in touch to let you know the team's decision regarding an offer or no offer.To help you prepare, we encourage you to visit our website, where we have a variety of case studies to help you grasp what types of projects we are engaged with on a day to day basis.
